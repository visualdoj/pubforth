# PubForth Continuous Integration

Now `make build` and `make test` are run every push by my [GitHub Action](https://github.com/visualdoj/pubforth/actions/workflows/github-actions.yml) on GitHub hosted servers! It simplifies testing `PubForth` on several operating systems. Otherwise I would be doing manually which is tedious and time-consuming.

Also it gives a status badge to be placed in readme file. That's cool I guess üï∂Ô∏è
