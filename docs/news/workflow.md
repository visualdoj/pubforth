# 15 june 2022: PubForth Continuous Integration

Now `make build` and `make test` are run every push by [GitHub Action](https://github.com/visualdoj/pubforth/actions/workflows/github-actions.yml) on GitHub hosted servers! It simplifies testing `PubForth` on several operating systems. Otherwise I would be doing that manually which is very tedious and time-consuming.

Also it gives a status badge to be placed in readme. That's cool I guess 🕶️
